# NMIXX 'MIXX POP' Quantitative Analyzer

### Project Overview
This project aims to quantify the structural complexity of K-POP tracks, specifically focusing on **NMIXX's 'MIXX POP' genre**. By converting abstract musical variations into objective data, this module calculates the **'MIXX Index'**, a custom metric designed to measure the intensity of structural changes.

### 📊 Key Metrics
1. **CPM (Change Per Minute):** - How frequently does the song structure change? (Density)
2. **Crest Factor:** - How drastic is the change? (Impact)
3. **MIXX Index:** - `CPM * Crest Factor`
   - Represents the total "structural dopamine" of the track.

### 🛠 Tech Stack
- **Language:** Python 3.x
- **Libraries:** Librosa (Audio Processing), Scipy (Signal Processing), NumPy
